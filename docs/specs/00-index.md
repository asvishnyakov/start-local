# Design Specs Index

> Internal design proposals: the "why/how" (problem, options, chosen approach, trade-offs) that precedes an implementation plan.
>
> **Living** while being drafted, overwritten in place. **Historical / append-only** once a plan is drawn against a spec or code exists: from then on, never rewrite it. Corrections and outcomes go in a dated *Amendments* / *Outcome* section, original intact, and the current tree is authoritative for what was built.

## Conventions & Writing Style

- Naming `YYYY-MM-DD-<kebab>.md` (authored date).
- Tone: problem statement → options → chosen approach → trade-offs. Specs hold the design, plans hold the steps.
- Cite decisions by ID from a spec's decision log and evidence by section from its research note, rather than restating them.

## Notes & Caveats

- **env-first-redesign** lists the facts still to verify while implementing in its §15.
- A spec marked "no plan yet" has been proposed but not executed.
- **redesign-choices** reviews the decision log and the spec as they stood on 2026-10-15. Its *Outcome* (§2.7) records which findings were applied.
