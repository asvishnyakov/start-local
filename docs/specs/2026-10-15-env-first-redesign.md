# start-local redesign: `.env`-first, release-pinned, HTTPS

Status: **draft**. This document stays living until an implementation plan is drawn against it. Decisions are cited by ID from the [decision log](2026-10-15-redesign-decisions.md). Evidence is cited by section from the [fact check](../research/2026-10-15-redesign-fact-check.md) (§N) and the [review follow-up](../research/2026-10-18-redesign-review-follow-up.md) (follow-up §N).

## 1. Problem

start-local works, but three things make it hard to automate and to extend:

1. **Configuration lives in parameters passed from script to script.** The unattended-setup draft (now stashed) needed 13 parameters on the installer, 11 on build and 7 on start. The same 5 start options were declared three times and forwarded create → build → start. Each new feature added another parameter in three places.
2. **The installer downloads 18 single files from the moving `dev` branch.** An installer saved earlier fetches whatever `dev` holds today, so the installer and the scripts can belong to different versions.
3. **Re-running the installer breaks existing data.** It regenerates every password, and an initialized database keeps the old one ([fact check §6](../research/2026-10-15-redesign-fact-check.md#6-re-running-todays-installer-breaks-db-volumes-live)).

There are further gaps:
- Everything serves plain HTTP, and every port binds to `0.0.0.0`.
- Redis runs but is never used (§18).
- The platform and modules can only run in Docker.
- The Elasticsearch settings fail on hosts that cap resource limits, such as CI runners and cloud VMs.
- Only the platform container restarts with Docker; the database and Elasticsearch don't.

## 2. Goals and non-goals

**Goals**
- `.env` is the single source of configuration. Scripts read it; they don't forward options to each other.
- Unattended setup in one call, for CI and Claude Code cloud routines.
- Installs are pinned to a release: the installer and the payload always come from the same version.
- HTTPS by default for the platform, storefront, Kibana and Elasticsearch.
- The platform and modules can each run from Docker or from source, and several source-run platforms can run side by side.
- Existing `VirtoLocal` folders keep working: they are migrated, not broken.

**Non-goals**
- Running the storefront from source. That is the developer's own setup (H8).
- Project-specific stacks, such as Marketplace or VirtoOZ. They differ only in modules and third-party services; their extra one or two processes (a frontend, a Python app) are the developer's to run.
- Installing certificate trust on the host (E5).
- Installing old releases through the new installer. `release/1.0` is reached with its own `VirtoLocal_create_local_files.ps1` (A10).
- Bash launchers. The scripts stay PowerShell 7 and cross-platform.

## 3. Approach

The model is borrowed from [asvishnyakov/virtocommerce](https://github.com/asvishnyakov/virtocommerce): one `.env` that Compose reads natively, scripts that do one job, and variation kept in data.

```
one-liner ─► bootstrap installer ─► resolve release ─► download one zip ─► run the payload's own installer
                                                                              │
             .env.example ─► .env (secrets filled once, empty keys asked once) ◄┘
                                │
             build / start / stop / remove ─── read .env, cd into the folder, run `docker compose`
                                │
                     COMPOSE_FILE = which compose files make up the stack
```

Rejected alternatives:
- **Keep the parameter chain and add `-nonInteractive` (V1).** It fixes unattended runs but keeps the forwarding problem.
- **A branch per project, as the reference repo does.** Projects need no changes to start-local: they differ only in modules and third-party services, which the package manifest and `.env` already cover.
- **Compose profiles for optional services.** Rejected in H9 for one mechanism, `COMPOSE_FILE`.
- **HTTP and HTTPS as alternative copies of each compose file.** Every shared setting would be written twice; HTTPS is an overlay instead (E13).

## 4. Releases and installation

### 4.1 Branches and releases

- Development stays on `dev` (A4).
- `release/1.0` is cut from the current `dev` **before** the redesign merges. It carries the old layout. A saved old installer reaches it with `-branch release/1.0`, and a new user downloads that branch's `VirtoLocal_create_local_files.ps1` and runs it (A5, A10). The raw URL form works for a branch name with a slash (§1).
- Without `-branch`, a saved old installer still downloads the files whose names survive (`docker-compose*.yml`, `scripts/`), then reaches the old build, start, stop and remove scripts, which on `dev` are only guards. Each guard throws an error that explains `release/1.0`, the new installer and migration (A5).
- Every release is a `release/X.Y` branch plus a `vX.Y.Z` tag and a GitHub Release (A1). The release attaches `install.ps1` as an asset (A8).
- The old README one-liner keeps working: `dev`'s `VirtoLocal_create_local_files.ps1` is a forwarder that downloads the latest release's `install.ps1` next to itself and calls `./install.ps1` with the same arguments (A9):

  ```powershell
  # Renamed to install.ps1 (start-local 2.0); forwards to the latest release.
  $installer = Join-Path $PSScriptRoot 'install.ps1'
  Invoke-WebRequest https://github.com/VirtoCommerce/start-local/releases/latest/download/install.ps1 -OutFile $installer
  & $installer @args
  ```
- The redesign ships as **v2.0.0**: the folder layout and the defaults change.

### 4.2 Bootstrap and delegation

The README one-liner downloads `github.com/VirtoCommerce/start-local/releases/latest/download/install.ps1` (A6).

That script runs as a **bootstrap**:

1. **Resolve the ref.** `-branch <ref>` is used if given. Otherwise the script calls `GET /repos/VirtoCommerce/start-local/releases/latest` (A7). That's one unauthenticated call, out of 60 per hour per IP (§3).
2. **Download one zip:** `github.com/VirtoCommerce/start-local/archive/refs/{tags|heads}/<ref>.zip` (A2). It goes to a temporary folder, and the top-level folder is named `start-local-<ref with / → ->` (§2).
3. **Delegate** to the `install.ps1` inside the zip, passing the bound parameters and the extracted path. Like nvm, **the installer that runs always matches its payload**. A payload without `install.ps1`, such as `release/1.0`, stops the bootstrap with a message that points to that ref's `VirtoLocal_create_local_files.ps1` (A10).

Network allowlists need these hosts for the bootstrap and the installer:
- `api.github.com`
- `github.com`
- `codeload.github.com`
- `release-assets.githubusercontent.com`

build also needs `raw.githubusercontent.com` for the vc-modules bundles (`bundles/stable.json`, `bundles/<name>/package.json`, B8), plus the hosts vc-build itself downloads from.

### 4.3 Installer

1. **Copy the payload** into `-targetFolder` (default `VirtoLocal`), overwriting scripts and compose files. It never touches `.env` (A3). Each old-named script in the folder (`build-`, `start-`, `stop-`, `remove-VC-solution.ps1`) is overwritten with its guard, which warns that the script is renamed and stops (A5).
2. **Create `.env`.** If there is no `.env`, copy `.env.example` (B2).
3. **Migrate** (§9).
4. **Fill secrets.** Each empty secret key gets a random value. Filled keys are never rotated, which fixes §6.
5. **Apply first-class parameters** to `.env` (§8).
6. **Ask for empty required keys** once, and save the answers (B3). In a non-interactive run (B4), a missing required value fails the run and names the key.
7. **Ask the per-run questions:** update vc-build, build now. Non-interactive runs take the defaults (C2).
8. **Run `build.ps1`**, passing only the per-run switches (`-skipSampleData`, `-nonInteractive`).

## 5. The solution folder

```

- **The DB provider is inferred** from `COMPOSE_FILE` (C3). There is no `DB_PROVIDER` key.
- **There are no heap keys.** Elasticsearch sizes its heap from `ES_MEM_LIMIT` (D2, §7).
- **Fixed values stay in the compose files**: the Elasticsearch cluster name and license (C6).
- **Ports keep their keys across modes.** HTTP mode and HTTPS mode publish the same `PLATFORM_PORT`; only the scheme changes.

### 5.2 Precedence

1. Per-run switches: `-skipSampleData`, `-nonInteractive`, and the step questions.
2. First-class parameters, which are also saved into `.env`.
3. `.env`.
4. `.env.example` defaults, filled in by migration for keys an old `.env` lacks.

### 5.3 Derived settings

Docker services have no generated settings files (C4). Each compose file derives its service's settings from `.env` through interpolation: connection strings from `DB_PASSWORD`, `REDIS_PASSWORD` and the ports, public URLs from `PLATFORM_PORT`, the search settings from `SEARCH_PROVIDER` and `ELASTIC_PASSWORD`. `environment:` uses the list form, so a key can interpolate too (`- Search__${SEARCH_PROVIDER}__Key=${ELASTIC_PASSWORD}`; the form is verified). The CA fingerprint, known only at runtime, comes through the certificates volume instead (§10). The scheme comes from the HTTPS overlays (§6).

A plain `docker compose up` in the folder always sees the current `.env`.

A platform run from source gets the same settings in its per-folder settings file (§7.2), computed by one PowerShell function from the same `.env`. The compose YAML and that function both define the platform settings; a test keeps them equal (§12).

## 6. The compose file set

`COMPOSE_FILE` lists the files that make up the stack. Users and switches pick **feature files**. The scripts maintain **link files** (C5), which wire two features together, and **HTTPS overlays** (E13), every time they run.

Link files exist because Compose refuses a `depends_on` on an undefined service, even with `required: false` (live test, 2026-10-15). They also keep the feature files independent: a platform run from source simply has no platform file.

HTTPS overlays exist so that each service is defined once. A feature or link file holds the settings both modes share, with HTTP behavior. Its `.https.yml` overlay adds TLS and overrides `environment:` entries by key (follow-up §2). The base file's overlay is the mode switch (E13).

| File | Kind | Content |
|------|------|---------|
| `docker-compose.yml` | base, always listed | Network and the volume name template `${VOLUME_PREFIX:-${COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME}}_*` (D3) |
| `docker-compose.https.yml` | overlay, listed in HTTPS mode | The certificates volume. Listing it is what puts the stack in HTTPS mode (E13) |
| `docker-compose.{postgres,mysql,sqlserver}.yml` | feature, exactly one | The `vc-db` service with a health check. The service name is the same for every provider |
| `docker-compose.platform.yml` | feature | `vc-platform-web`: image `vc-platform:${COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME}-latest` (D3), settings interpolated from `.env` (§5.3), `depends_on: vc-db` (healthy), `VirtoCommerce__AllowInsecureHttp=true`. Left out when the platform runs from source or is skipped |
| `docker-compose.platform.https.yml` | overlay | Kestrel with the dev cert from the certificates volume; `VirtoCommerce__AllowInsecureHttp=false` |
| `docker-compose.platform-modules.yml` | link (script) | Bind mounts from `MODULE_SOURCE_PATHS` (H2); only when the platform runs in Docker and source modules are set |
| `docker-compose.elasticsearch.yml` | feature | `es` with security off, as today, but the cluster name and license fixed (C6) |
| `docker-compose.elasticsearch.https.yml` | overlay | The setup container (CA, certs, `ca/ca.fingerprint`, `kibana_system` password, health check); security and TLS on for `es` (E3, E11) |
| `docker-compose.kibana.yml` | feature | Kibana, as today |
| `docker-compose.kibana.https.yml` | overlay | Kibana serving TLS with a cert from the setup CA, and signing in to Elasticsearch over TLS (E9) |
| `docker-compose.frontend.yml` | feature | Storefront nginx, image `vc-frontend:${COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME}-latest` (D3), the HTTP nginx template |
| `docker-compose.frontend.https.yml` | overlay | The HTTPS nginx template with the dev cert (E8) |
| `docker-compose.redis.yml` | feature, listed by default | Redis as a pure cache, with no volume (D6) |
| `docker-compose.platform-<feature>.yml` | link (script) | The platform's `depends_on` and settings for Elasticsearch and Redis (`ConnectionStrings__RedisConnectionString`, D6), and the storefront's `depends_on` for the platform |
| `docker-compose.platform-elasticsearch.https.yml` | overlay (script) | The HTTPS server URL, and the certificates volume mounted read-only, so the entrypoint finds `ca/ca.fingerprint` (E11) |
| `docker-compose.frontend-hostplatform.yml` | link (script) | `extra_hosts: host.docker.internal:host-gateway` when the storefront runs in Docker and the platform runs from source (H7) |
| `docker-compose.es-limited.yml` | feature, opt-in | `discovery.type=single-node`, `bootstrap.memory_lock=false`, `ulimits: !reset {}` (D1, H10). Safe on existing data (§5) |

Further rules:
- **Fixed container ports.** The platform and the storefront listen on one fixed container port in both modes. HTTPS or HTTP comes from the overlay (Kestrel URLs, the nginx template directory). Port mappings never change, and `!override` is never needed.
- **Autostart (D10).** Every long-running service has `restart: unless-stopped`; the Elasticsearch setup container has none.
- **Normalization.** Every script run rewrites `COMPOSE_FILE` in a canonical order. It adds the link files whose two features are present and removes those whose features aren't. When `docker-compose.https.yml` is listed, it lists the overlay of every listed file that has one; otherwise it removes them all. Skipping and re-adding a feature therefore never changes the mode. Unknown files, such as the user's own overrides, keep their position after the built-in files.

## 7. Docker or source

### 7.1 Choosing the mode

| Part | Docker | From source |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Platform | `PLATFORM_SOURCE_PATH` empty | `PLATFORM_SOURCE_PATH` is a vc-platform checkout (`dotnet run --no-build --project src/VirtoCommerce.Platform.Web`) or a prebuilt folder (`dotnet VirtoCommerce.Platform.Web.dll`); detected from the contents (H4) |
| Modules | from the package manifest (vc-build) | `MODULE_SOURCE_PATHS`: either `*.Web` folders (have `module.manifest`) or one whole `modules` folder, never both (H2) |
| Storefront | `docker-compose.frontend.yml` listed | not supported; the developer runs it with yarn (H8) |
| DB, Elasticsearch, Kibana, Redis | always Docker | not applicable |

The user or the IDE builds the source parts. start only runs them, and fails fast when the build output is missing (H6). With `-skipPlatform`, start prepares the platform without launching it, so the user can build it and run it from the debugger (B6).

### 7.2 Platform from source

- **Config (H5).** start writes the platform settings to `VirtoCommerce.Platform.Web.settings.json` in the platform's content root: `src/VirtoCommerce.Platform.Web/` of a checkout, or the prebuilt folder. .NET 10 loads that file after `appsettings.{env}.json` and reloads it on change (follow-up §1).
  - **Per folder.** Each platform folder has its own file, so two source-run platforms can run side by side, each with its own `.env` and stack (D3): for example VirtoOZ's management platform and a tenant platform.
  - **IDE runs** read the same file when the IDE's working directory is the content root.
  - **A clean checkout.** In a checkout, start adds the file name to `.git/info/exclude`.
  - **No user secrets.** The user-secrets store is one per machine and overrides the file, so the preflight warns when it defines a key start writes (§11).
  - start launches with `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development`, from the content root as the working directory.
- **Modules (H2).** `MODULE_SOURCE_PATHS` holds one of two forms.
  - **`*.Web` folders:** each is symlinked as `<platform>/modules/<module id>`.
  - **One `modules` folder:** it becomes the platform's modules folder. `<platform>/modules` is a symlink to it, as in `VirtoCommerce.Platform/modules -> ../modules`. vc-build installs into it, so installed binaries and module source checkouts sit side by side. If `<platform>/modules` is a real directory with content, start refuses and names it.
  - start uses directory symlinks on every OS. The platform follows them on Linux (§13) and on Windows (the user's own setups, fact check *Amendments*). Creating one on Windows needs Developer Mode or an elevated shell; the preflight checks for it and names the fix (§11).
- **Process.** The platform runs in the background, writes `logs/platform.log`, and records `logs/platform.pid`. stop stops it. Docker's restart policy doesn't cover it (D10).
- **Skipped (B6).** With `SKIP_PLATFORM=true`, start writes the settings file and the module links, starts the Docker services, and prints the command to launch the platform. It doesn't launch it or wait for it.
- **Addresses.** The platform reaches Docker services through `localhost` and the published ports, which is why the Elasticsearch cert includes `localhost` (E3).

### 7.3 Platform in Docker with source modules

A `*.Web` entry becomes a bind mount at `/opt/virtocommerce/platform/modules/<module id>`, where the module id comes from `module.manifest`, replacing the installed copy of that module. This is the platform docs' "link the Module Web directory" workflow.

A `modules` folder is bind-mounted at `/opt/virtocommerce/platform/modules` itself, replacing the image's modules. build then has vc-build install the package manifest's modules into that folder instead of the image (the vc-build option is to be verified).

## 8. Scripts and parameters

`.env` carries the configuration, so parameters are few and none is forwarded except per-run switches.

| Parameter | Installer | build | start | remove | Persists to |
|-----------|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|-------------|
| `-targetFolder` / `-solutionFolder` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | (folder) |
| `-branch` | ✓ | | | | `START_LOCAL_REF` |
| `-dbProvider postgres\|mysql\|sqlserver` | ✓ | | ✓ | | `COMPOSE_FILE` |
| `-releaseChannel` (B8), `-customPackagesJson`, `-customFrontendUrl` | ✓ | ✓ | | | `RELEASE_CHANNEL`, `CUSTOM_*` |
| `-allowInsecureHttp` (B7) | ✓ | | ✓ | | `COMPOSE_FILE` (no `.https` overlays) |
| `-skipPlatform`, `-skipFrontend`, `-skipElasticsearch`, `-skipKibana`, `-skipRedis` (B6) | ✓ | | ✓ | | `COMPOSE_FILE`; `SKIP_PLATFORM` for a source platform |
| `-skipSampleData [bool]` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | | per run (C2) |
| `-nonInteractive` (B4; also automatic when stdin is redirected or `CI=true`) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | per run |
| `-keepData` (F6) | | | | ✓ | per run |
| `-elasticsearchVersion` | `[Obsolete]` (B1) | | | | `STACK_VERSION` |
| `-vcSolutionVersion` | `[Obsolete]` (B1) | `[Obsolete]` | | | `RELEASE_CHANNEL` |

- **Grouping.** The skip switches sit under one comment section in each `param` block. They stay separate parameters (B6). Each is undone with `-<switch>:$false`.
- **One implementation.** Parameters that persist are applied by one helper (`scripts/options.ps1`), shared by the installer and start. PowerShell needs each script to declare its own `param` block, so declaring them in two scripts is the remaining duplication. Build keeps its existing solution parameters.
- **Obsolete parameters** use `[Obsolete("Use …")]`. PowerShell prints a warning only when the parameter is passed (§15). Their lifetime is open (B1).
- **Admin password (C1).** Interactive runs never touch it: `admin` / `store` with the platform's change-password prompt. Non-interactive runs apply `ADMIN_PASSWORD` on every start through `POST /api/platform/security/users/admin/resetpassword` with `forcePasswordChangeOnNextSignIn: false`, and first generate and save one when the key is empty. That includes migrated folders.
- **Optional files without a switch.** Capped limits are switched on by adding their file to `COMPOSE_FILE`. A cloud wrapper writes `VirtoLocal/.env` before the first install. B2 keeps that file, and the installer fills only the keys left empty.

### 8.1 Script flow

- **build:**
  1. When the platform runs in Docker: `vc-build install` for `RELEASE_CHANNEL` (B8) and the platform image. With a `modules` folder, vc-build installs the modules into that folder (§7.3).
  2. When the storefront is listed: the storefront image, from the bundle's `ThemeB2BVue` for `stable` and `stable:<N>`, or the latest vc-frontend release for `edge`.
  3. In HTTPS mode: export the dev cert (§10).
  4. Optionally, start.
- **start:**
  1. `cd` into the folder (required, §4).
  2. Migrate, then preflight checks (§11).
  3. Normalize `COMPOSE_FILE`.
  4. For a platform run from source: write its settings file from `.env` (§7.2), and place the module links. In HTTPS mode, bring up the Elasticsearch setup first and copy `ca/ca.fingerprint` from the certificates volume into the settings file (§10).
  5. `docker compose up -d`.
  6. Launch the platform from source, if configured and not skipped.
  7. Unless the platform is skipped: wait for it, then check the installed modules.
  8. Unless the platform is skipped: in non-interactive runs, apply the admin password (C1). Then sample data (per run).
  9. Print the URLs, plus trust instructions when the cert isn't trusted. A skipped platform gets the command to launch it instead of its URL.
- **stop:** `docker compose down`, plus stopping the source-run platform when its pid file exists.
- **remove (F6):**
  - Full: `down -v`, deleting volumes by `VOLUME_PREFIX` (as today, with the prefix in place of the fixed `virto_*` names), removing the images and the folder.
  - `-keepData`: `down` without `-v`, removing the images and every file in the folder except `.env`. Re-running the installer over the folder restores the stack with its data.

## 9. Migration

Every script runs `scripts/migrate.ps1` first. It is idempotent and keyed on `START_LOCAL_LAYOUT`, and a missing key means layout 1 (F1). Steps from layout 1 to 2:

1. **`DB_PROVIDER` becomes `COMPOSE_FILE`**, with the same provider, `COMPOSE_PATH_SEPARATOR=;`, Redis, and no HTTPS overlays. Migrated folders run in **HTTP mode**, so their URLs keep working (E1, E12).
2. **Missing keys are added** with `.env.example` defaults, plus `VOLUME_PREFIX=virto`, so existing volumes keep their names (D3). Existing values and passwords are kept. `STACK_VERSION` stays as it is: 8.18.0 needs no data migration (D7).
3. **Keys the layout no longer reads are removed:** `DB_PROVIDER` (after step 1), `ES_CLUSTER_NAME` and `ES_LICENSE` (C6).
4. **`BIND_ADDRESS=127.0.0.1`** applies to migrated folders too (D9). The upgrade output says how to restore `0.0.0.0`.
5. **Images are retagged**: `vc-platform:local-latest` and `vc-frontend:local-latest` get the per-project tag (`docker tag`), so no rebuild is needed (D3).
6. **`START_LOCAL_LAYOUT=2`** is written.

Redis now runs as a pure cache with no volume (D6). The old `virto_redisdata` volume is left alone, and a full remove deletes it. No step deletes data, so migration asks nothing (F2).

The installer replaces the payload files (§4.3). Migration changes only `.env` and Docker state.

## 10. HTTPS

| Endpoint | Cert | How |
|----------|------|-----|
| Platform | `dotnet dev-certs` (E4) | Exported as `localhost.pem` + `localhost.key`. Kestrel reads them through `Kestrel__Certificates__Default__{Path,KeyPath}` (verified, §11) |
| Storefront | The same export (E8) | nginx `ssl_certificate` / `ssl_certificate_key` in the HTTPS template. It proxies to the platform over HTTPS without verifying the internal hop |
| Elasticsearch | The setup CA (E3) | Elastic's official setup container cut to one node. TLS on HTTP and transport, security on |
| Kibana | The setup CA (E9) | `server.ssl.enabled`, with a `kibana` entry in `instances.yml` |

Further rules:
- **Delivery to containers (E10).** The dev-cert export goes into the named certificates volume with `docker cp`, through a short-lived helper container. Docker Desktop refuses bind mounts from paths outside its File Sharing list (§14), so only module source paths need File Sharing (§11).
- **The platform trusts Elasticsearch (E11)** through `Search:<Provider>:CertificateFingerprint`, a property both modules support (§9). The fingerprint never passes through `.env`:
  - The setup container writes the CA's SHA-256 to `ca/ca.fingerprint` in the certificates volume. The ES image has no `openssl`, so it uses `sed '/-----/d' ca.crt | base64 -d | sha256sum`, which gives the same value as `openssl x509 -fingerprint -sha256` (verified, ES 9.5.5).
  - The Docker platform's entrypoint, which start-local owns (D5), exports `Search__${SEARCH_PROVIDER}__CertificateFingerprint` from that file, then starts `dotnet`. A plain `docker compose up` therefore works end to end.
  - For a platform run from source, start copies the file from the volume into the platform's settings file.
  - The fingerprint format the module expects (lowercase hex without colons, or the colon form) is to be confirmed when implementing.
- **Search provider (D8).** `SEARCH_PROVIDER` in `.env`, default `ElasticSearch8`, which also works with Elasticsearch 9 servers. Neither bundle ships ES9 (§9).
- **Trust (E5).** The scripts never install it. When the dev cert is untrusted, start prints two routes: `dotnet dev-certs https --trust` (Windows, macOS; Ubuntu and Fedora with .NET 9+ and `SSL_CERT_DIR` set), or copying the export into the system store (`/usr/local/share/ca-certificates` + `update-ca-certificates`) (§11). The setup CA is printed with the same instructions.
- **HTTP mode (E1, E12).** `-allowInsecureHttp` removes every `.https.yml` overlay from `COMPOSE_FILE` (E13), which leaves today's behavior; the platform file keeps `VirtoCommerce:AllowInsecureHttp=true`. The stack is never served over both at once.

## 11. Preflight checks

These fail fast with a message that names the fix:

- **PowerShell 7 or later.**
- **Docker running, and Compose v2.18.0 or later** (D4; inferred minimum, §4).
- **Ports free**: the existing check, limited to the services in `COMPOSE_FILE`.
- **Docker Desktop file sharing** for each bind-mounted `MODULE_SOURCE_PATHS` entry: a probe `docker run --rm -v <path>:/x:ro` that reports `mounts denied` (§14).
- **`MODULE_SOURCE_PATHS` form**: `*.Web` folders or one `modules` folder, not a mix (H2).
- **Symlink rights on Windows**, when source modules or a source platform need links: Developer Mode or an elevated shell (§7.2).
- **Source-mode build output**: `VirtoCommerce.Platform.Web.dll` present, or the checkout already built (H6). Skipped when the platform is skipped (B6).
- **Required `.env` keys** in non-interactive runs (B3, B4).

Two checks only warn:
- **Shadowing user secrets**: the machine's `VirtoCommerce.Platform.Web` user-secrets store defines a key that the source platform's settings file sets (H5).
- Failures of the installed-modules check and of sample data are reported but don't stop the run, as today.

## 12. Testing

start-local has no tests or CI today. CI runs on GitHub-hosted runners (G1, follow-up §5).

- **Unit (Pester 5).** These cover the pure functions:
  - reading and writing `.env` with comments and order preserved;
  - filling secrets without ever rotating them;
  - `COMPOSE_FILE` normalization (links, HTTPS overlays) and provider inference, including that skipping and re-adding features never changes the HTTPS mode;
  - the settings-file function, checked against `docker compose config` for the platform service from the same `.env`, so the YAML and the function can't drift (§5.3);
  - each migration step, against real layout-1 `.env` fixtures;
  - mapping parameters to `.env`.
- **Compose config.** `docker compose config` for every supported combination: 3 providers × platform Docker / source / skipped × storefront on or off × Elasticsearch on or off × Redis on or off × HTTPS or HTTP, plus capped limits. It needs no Docker daemon (verified in a sandbox), so it runs anywhere.
- **Smoke.** A non-interactive install with capped limits and `stable`, in HTTPS mode. It checks platform health and an authenticated API call. A second job migrates a layout-1 folder created with `release/1.0`'s `VirtoLocal_create_local_files.ps1`.

| Tier | Ubuntu | Windows | macOS |
|------|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Unit (Pester 5) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Compose config | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ (Compose installed by the workflow) |
| Smoke | ✓ | only if the WSL2 probe passes | ✗ (no Linux containers on arm64 runners) |

- **Runners.** The Ubuntu runner is the only hosted one with Linux containers. The Windows runner's Docker runs Windows containers only, and macOS arm64 runners have no nested virtualization. The smoke job uses PostgreSQL and leaves out Kibana, to fit the runner's memory.

## 13. Delivery

1. Cut `release/1.0` from `dev`, tag `v1.0.0`, and publish the GitHub Release with the current installer as its asset.
2. Run `.github/workflows/runner-probe.yml` (G1), to settle the Windows smoke lane. It runs on the push that adds or changes it.
3. Open one PR against `dev`, or two if it grows too large. Decide once the size is known (F4).
4. Release `v2.0.0`. The README one-liner switches to the release-asset URL in the same release.

## 14. Trade-offs

- **Link files and overlays** are extra files, and a hand-edited `COMPOSE_FILE` depends on the next script run to add them. The price buys feature files that stay independent, each service defined once, and the Compose-native `.env`.
- **Platform settings are defined twice**: in the compose YAML for Docker and in the settings-file function for a source run (§5.3). The price buys a `docker compose` that always sees the current `.env`; the drift test in §12 guards it.
- **The settings file needs .NET 10** and the content root as the working directory (H5). Older platforms and IDEs launched from elsewhere don't see it.
- **HTTPS by default** brings in a dev-cert export and Elasticsearch security (setup container, Kibana sign-in). HTTP mode keeps today's behavior one switch away.
- **Migrated folders change in two deliberate ways**: ports bind to localhost (D9), and the platform starts using Redis as its cache backplane (D6).

## 15. To verify while implementing

Every design choice is decided; only C1's saving of a generated admin password is assumed rather than asked. These facts are still unverified:

- Compose v2.18.0 support for `${COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME}` and nested defaults (D3; verified on v5.5.1).
- The vc-build option that installs into an external `modules` folder (§7.3).
- The fingerprint format the search module expects: lowercase hex without colons, or the colon form (E11).
- The working directory that Rider, VS Code and Visual Studio use for a platform launch, which must be the content root for the settings file (H5).
- That the platform exits when the database or Elasticsearch isn't ready after a daemon restart, so its restart policy retries it (D10).
- Docker in WSL2 on the Windows runner (G1).
