# Research Notes Index

> Dated investigations (findings, library behavior, trade-offs) that informed a decision, usually the precursor to a spec of the same topic.
>
> **Historical / append-only.** A note reflects what was understood on its date; never rewrite a finding. Corrections and outcomes go in a dated *Amendments* / *Outcome* section, original intact. Check conclusions against the current tree, or the matching spec, before relying on them.

## Conventions & Writing Style

- Naming `YYYY-MM-DD-<kebab>.md`. Exploratory tone: evidence, citations, conclusions.
- Give each finding a verdict (Confirmed / Partial / Unverified). Mark *live* when it was tested, and state the environment it was tested in.

## Notes & Caveats

- **redesign-fact-check** was tested on one machine (Ubuntu 24.04, Docker Desktop, Compose v5.5.1). Windows behavior, especially directory junctions and `COMPOSE_PATH_SEPARATOR`, is inferred from docs, not tested.
- **redesign-review-follow-up** describes GitHub runners from their image READMEs only; no probe workflow had run on its date. IDE working directories for the per-folder settings file are unchecked.
